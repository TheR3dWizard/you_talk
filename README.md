# you_talk

A flutter project to create an app that can help keep track of a conversation or meeting or train of thought. You can add new topics at any time but only remove the top topic. This is to help you stay on track and not get distracted by other topics. This would best be used in a meeting or conversation with one person keeping track of the topics and the other person talking about them. This is not meant to be a note taking app but a way to keep track of what you are talking about.

# To implement
You can also add notes to each topic to help you remember what you were talking about.
